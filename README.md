# NES-001
Various sketches related to interfacing with my NES-001

## NES-controller-IN
Uses a Pro Trinket(5V) to read input from a NES controller.
Note: This is installed in such a way to tap the data going from the controller to the NES, so the latch and clock data are not generated by the arduino.
